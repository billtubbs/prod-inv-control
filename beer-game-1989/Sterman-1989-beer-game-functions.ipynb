    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock management control problem is divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. the stock and flow structure of the system\n",
    " 2. the decision rule used by the manager\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    " - $S(t)$ : Stock level at time $t$ (i.e. inventory).\n",
    " - $A(t)$ : Acquisition rate at time $t$ (i.e. additions to stock, such as deliveries from the supplier).\n",
    " - $L(t)$ : Loss rate at time $t$ (i.e. reductions from stock, such as shipments to the customer).\n",
    " - $O(t)$ : Actual orders at time $t$, $O(t) \\ge 0$.\n",
    " - ${IO}(t)$ : Indicated orders at time $t$.\n",
    " - $\\hat{L}(t)$ : Expected stock losses at time $t$.\n",
    " - ${AS}(t)$ : Difference between desired and actual stock at time $t$.\n",
    " - ${ASL}(t)$ : Difference between desired and actual supply line at time $t$.\n",
    " - $S^*(t)$ : Desired stock level at time $t$.\n",
    " - ${SL}^*(t)$ : Desired supply line level at time $t$.\n",
    " - $\\alpha_{s}$ : Decision rule parameter – the adjustment rate for the stock.\n",

    "### Stock and flow system model\n",

    "The acquisition rate depends on the supply line of units, $SL(t)$, which have been ordered but not yet received, and the average acquisition lag, $\\lambda$. The supply line at the next time instant is simply the accumulation of the orders placed in the current period $O(t)$, less those which have been delivered $A(t)$:\n",
