For the first four weeks players are instructed to order four cases per week to maintain the initial equilibrium.  Begining with week four the players are allowed to order any non-negative quantity they wish. There is an unnannounced, one-time increase in customer demand to eight cases per week in week 5. Players are told the game will run for 50 simulated weeks but play is actually halted ater 36 weeks to avoid horizon effects."
